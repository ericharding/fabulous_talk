### I know this
<!-- Even though Fabulous is relatively new
it feels familiar because most pieces stay the same
-->

---

## F#
* No separate UI language
* No new tools needed

---

## Domain Modeling
* Works with your _existing_ model
* Make illegal states unrepresentable

---

## Immutability
* Designed for functional languages
* No required mutability
<!-- Never have to add a setter -->

---
## Model View Update
* One way data flow
* Single source of truth

---

# MVC

![](images/Abe_Simpson.png)
<!-- The classic UI pattern, 
MVC Smalltalk 79
Ask 5 developers what MVC is and you'll get 5 answers
-->

---

# MVP
<!-- basically still MVC... -->

---

# MVVM

<img src="images/MVVMPattern.png" width="70%" />

<!-- Accidental complexity
separate designer tooling
code like constructs (behaviors, converters)
-->

---

# MV_ 
> Where's the State?
> -- Jim Bennett

<!-- MV_ can be a bit vague.  MVU is not vague.  You can tell by the type signatures 
-->

---

## Tech Support
![](images/hello_it.jpg)
<!--
Reboot to fix it is so ingrained
I physically cut my fiber. It was sticking out of the ground and I could look at both ends.
They wouldn't send someone out to fix it until I had rebooted my modem.
-->

***

# MVU

![](images/model-view-update.svg)

---

# MVU

    Model -> (Msg->unit) -> Elements
    Model -> Msg -> Model

<!-- not vague -->

---

# Model üóø
* The **only** state
* Immutable
* üêõ Debugable

<!--
You can't hide state anywhere else
Debugging advantages
    - reproduce problems
    - serialize state
    - Time travel debugging
-->

---

# View üëÄ

    Model -> (Msg->unit) -> Lightweight Element Tree


<!-- Xamarin forms DSL
Not the same as fable but that's ok
Live reload
Same language, easy refactoring
-->

# Update ‚ôª

    Model -> Msg -> Model

<!-- synchronous -->

# Example

---

    type Model =
        { count : int }

    type Msg =
        | Increment
        | Decrement

    let init () = { count = 0 }, Cmd.none

---

    let update msg model =
        match msg with
        | Increment -> { model with count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none
        | Decrement -> { model with count = model.count - 1 }, Cmd.none

---

    let view (model: Model) dispatch =
        View.ContentPage(
          content = 
            View.StackLayout(
                children = [ 
                    View.Label(text = sprintf "%d" model.count, 
                        widthRequest=200.0)
                    View.Button(text = "Increment", 
                        command = (fun () -> dispatch Increment))
                    View.Button(text = "Decrement", 
                        command = (fun () -> dispatch Decrement))
                ]))

# Scaling
* What about components?

# "Triplets"
<!-- fractal components -->

    type Model = 
      { counter : Counter.Model
        text : Reverser.Model }

---
    
    type Msg = 
        | CounterMsg of Counter.Msg 
        | ReverserMsg of Reverser.Msg

---

    let init () = 
        let cstate, ccmd = Counter.init()
        let rstate, rcmd = Reverser.init()
        { counter = cstate; text = rstate },

    let update msg model =

        | CounterMsg m -> 
            let (cstate, ccmd) = Counter.update m model.counter
            { model with counter = cstate }, Cmd.map CounterMsg ccmd
        | ReverserMsg m -> 
            let (rstate, rcmd) = Reverser.update m model.text
            { model with text = rstate }, Cmd.map ReverserMsg rcmd

    let view (model: Model) dispatch =
        View.ContentPage(
          content = View.StackLayout(
            children = [ 
                Counter.view model.counter (CounterMsg>>dispatch)
                Reverser.view model.text (ReverserMsg>>dispatch)
            ]))

## When?
![](images/lazy.gif)
<!--
When should I break stuff up?
Break up view/update into functions constantly
In XAML this refactoring is painful, in f# it is not

## Auth0

    type IAuthenticationService = 
        abstract member AuthenticateAsync : unit -> 
        Async<IdentityModel.OidcClient.LoginResult>

<!--
    implement interface for all platforms

## Animations 
* Off the UI thread
<!--

WPF / 16ms

    let pulseImage dispatch (image:Image) =
        async {
            for _ in 1..10 do
                let! _ = Async.AwaitTask (image.FadeTo(0.1, 500u))

    let private flyIn (g:Grid) =
        g.TranslationY <- 500.
        g.TranslateTo(0., 0., 1000u, Easing.BounceOut)

    let view model dispatch =
        View.Grid(
            created = flyIn,
            children = [...])

### TODO: talk about animations triggered by messages
- borrow from don dyme's talk

---

## External Data
* Commands
    - returns a message
* Subscriptions
    - dispatches multiple messages

    let delayMsg milliseconds msg = Cmd.ofAsyncMsg (async {

        return msg
    })

---

    | GoToConversation otherUser -> 
        { model with Page = Page.Conversation { OtherUser = otherUser; Messages = []; UnsentMessage = "" } },
        Support.delayMsg 1000 
            (ChatReceived <| 
                { Message.User = otherUser; 
                  Text = ChatBot.greeting model.User })

### Xamarin Essentials

    type ILocationService =
        abstract member GetLocation : unit -> Location option

---

    let locationSub dispatch =
        let locationService = DependencyService.Get<ILocationService>()
        async {
            let loc = locationService.GetLocation()
            dispatch (Location loc)
            do! Async.Sleep 1000
        } |> Async.StartImmidiate

    ...
    Cmd.ofSub locationSub
