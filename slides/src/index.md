### I know this
<!-- Even though Fabulous is relatively new
it feels familiar because most pieces stay the same
-->

---

## F#
* No separate UI language
* No new tools needed

---

## Domain Modeling
* Works with your _existing_ model
* Make illegal states unrepresentable

---

## Immutability
* Designed for functional languages
* No required mutability

---
## Model View Update
* One way data flow
* Single source of truth
<!-- * "fractal" components -->
<!-- * A library Not a framework -->

# MVC

<!-- The classic UI pattern, 
MVC Smalltalk 79
Ask 5 developers what MVC is and you'll get 5 answers

# MVP
<!-- basically still MVC... -->

# MVVM

# MV_ 
<!-- ### Can be a bit vague -->

> Where's the State?

<!-- MVU is not vague.  You can tell by the type signatures 
-->

# MVU

* view  : Model -> (Msg->unit) -> Elements
* update : Model -> Msg -> Model
<!-- not vague -->

# Model
* The **only** state
<!--
You can't hide state anywhere else
-->

# Update

## Counter

    type Model =
        { count : int }

    type Msg =
        | Increment
        | Decrement

    let init () = { count = 0 }, Cmd.none

    let view (model: Model) dispatch =
        View.ContentPage(
          content = 
            View.StackLayout(padding = 20.0,
                children = [ 
                    View.Label(text = sprintf "%d" model.count, 
                        widthRequest=200.0)
                    View.Button(text = "Increment", 
                        command = (fun () -> dispatch Increment),
                        horizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center)
                    View.Button(text = "Decrement", 
                        command = (fun () -> dispatch Decrement), 
                        horizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center)
