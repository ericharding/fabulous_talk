==========================

MVVM
- OO programming
- Complex mutable models
- declarative static UI
- view in a second language
- complex designer tooling

Xaml
- accidental complexity
    - bindings/ templates
    - code-like constructs (behaviors, converters)
    - designer tools (shitty)
    - CanExecute!  (stateful)

MVU
- Functional programming
- simple declarative models
- declarative dynamic UI
- view in same language DSL
- Simple live coding tooling
    - same language tooling

- unidirectional data flow


# Familiarity
- When you jump into an unknown Xaml project what do you know?
- Not very much.  Does it use Rx? MvvmLite?
