### I know this
<!-- Even though Fabulous is relatively new
it feels familiar because most pieces stay the same
-->

---

## F#
* No separate UI language
* No new tools needed

---

## Domain Modeling
* Works with your _existing_ model
* Make illegal states unrepresentable

---

## Immutability
* Designed for functional languages
* No required mutability

---
## Model View Update
* One way data flow
* Single source of truth
<!-- * "fractal" components -->
* A library Not a framework

### Can be a bit vague

<!-- MVU is not vague.  You can tell by the type signatures 
Where's the state?
